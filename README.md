## Documentation & API
I haven't made any documentation yet. But... I left much comment in my script. hope you understand it :') <br />
Else... you could read it from `/web/test` there are some examples to make you understand how to use this framework. <br />
Otherwise, there are `/references.js` for how much property that changes in each plugins, `/lib/lib.template.js` to making your plugin with your own self, `/config.js` to configure your server and etc.

Please be kind to helping me made a documentation. <br />
Thankyou ^_^
